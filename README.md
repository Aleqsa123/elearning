## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge was important in understanding responsive design and background picture position better. I advanced in mobile-first workflow and doing breakouts. I also understood paddings and box-sizing much better. Background positioning was again hard for me. At this time I used relative units "rem"-s.

I love this CSS:
```css
    header {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 280px;
        grid-template-rows: repeat(4, auto);
        margin-top: 2.4rem;
        padding-right: 4rem;
        padding-left: 3.9rem;
        background-image: url(./assets/image-hero-tablet.png);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-size: contain;
        background-position: top -6.5rem right -28.5rem;
    }


### Continued development

Now it's time to take projects with javascript. Also mastering markup will be useful.
